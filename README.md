# Problem Description:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning system that can predict human activities using data collected from smartphone sensors. The activities to be classified include walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying. This problem has practical applications in areas such as health monitoring, fitness tracking, and human-computer interaction.

# Dataset:
The UCI Machine Learning Repository provides a labeled dataset for this task. The dataset includes sensor signals collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a smartphone carried by participants while performing the activities.
